</p>


Puzzle Pipe is a procedural puzzle game that allows you to keep problem-solving skills in training. The purpose of the game is to connect two main pipes that are highlighted in a different color through other pipes in order to create a path that allows the two main pipes to communicate. Once you have created a valid route you can go to the next round. This game was born as a playground delivered to the <strong>WWDC18</strong> scholarship.
